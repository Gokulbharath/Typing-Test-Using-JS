# Typing-Test-Using-JS
## Overview
This project is a **Typing Test** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, where users can test their typing speed and accuracy. A unique feature of the test is a **school bus visualization** that moves from a school to a home as the user types. The bus speed depends on the user's typing speed, and it tracks the Words Per Minute (WPM), errors, and changes between different paragraphs.

## Features
- Real-time **WPM** (Words Per Minute) calculation
- **Error** count tracking
- A dynamic school bus that moves towards home based on typing speed
- Multiple paragraphs that randomly change after each test
- Customizable themes and layouts
- Responsive design

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: Structure of the website
- **CSS**: Styling for the test, bus animation, and responsive layout
- **JavaScript**: Logic for calculating WPM, errors, and moving the bus

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A text editor to modify the code (VSCode, Sublime, etc.)

### Steps to Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/typing-test-bus.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd typing-test-bus
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to start the typing test.

## Usage
- **Typing Test**: 
    - A paragraph is displayed for the user to type.
    - Typing speed is calculated as WPM in real time, along with any errors.
    - The faster you type, the quicker the school bus moves towards home.

- **Visualization**: 
    - The bus starts at the school and progresses toward home based on the user's typing speed. The visualization resets with each new paragraph.

- **Paragraph Changes**: 
    - Each test starts with a random paragraph, and users can switch to a new one after completing or resetting the test.
